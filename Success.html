                        </div>
                        <p>During my main school years, I had a lot of anxiety, particularly in social situations. After the COVID-19 lockdowns, the anxiety was definitely heightened.</p>
                        <div class="more" id="more1" style="display: none;">
                            <p>This made it incredibly hard to get to know others outside of my ‘comfort circle,’ but I knew it was something I needed to do. I understood that creating relationships with other people would challenge my own worries but also allow me to extend my network of friends. Eventually, I was able to broaden my horizons and start speaking to others by trying to be kind and trustworthy as often as possible. I began to understand that there are loads of advantages to meeting new people and creating healthy relationships with your peers at school.</p>

                        <p>For many years now I have lived with depression and anxiety. Depression has a habit of sneaking up when things start to get on top of me. It only takes a few triggers, and I can be sent into a tailspin.</p>
                        <div class="more" id="more2" style="display: none;">
                            <p>Thankfully, this doesn't happen too frequently, but when it does, it’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But from experience, I have found that there always is.</p>

                        <p>Teenagers sometimes have spots, and as a young teenager in school, this was something I experienced. It was never really a major concern for me since I recognised it was a part of puberty.</p>

                            <p>So, a couple of spots here and there may have been different to my preteen spotless face, but it still was never drastic enough to worry me. This all changed when I reached my later teenage years. As I continued to grow and my body continued to develop, I started to notice my skin increasingly change.</p>
